# vim-snips

At the moment this is a small, personal collection of snippets that I use with [UltiSnips](https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips).

So far, there are snippets for:

- Armv7 + Thumb2 unified assembly
- .snippets files (ported from vim-snippets)

More will come as I start using this for more languages. If for some reason you're looking at this repo in its early stages, 
feel free to make a pull request with more. Keep them simple, though.
